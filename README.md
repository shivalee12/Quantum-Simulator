## Name
Quantum Simulator

## Description
- Its a Quantum simulator which can apply single and 2 qubit gates 
- It is made completely from scratch i.e it does not make use of any Quantum library or numpy


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Usage
For stimulating circuit you can use the following methods:
1. read_unitary()= Return a single unitary matrix (quantum operator) equivalant to all defined quantum operators until this point, i.e., the multiplication of all quantum operators in the defined order.
2. read_state: Return the current quantum state of circuit.
3. observing_probabilities(): Return the probabilisties of observing the basis states if all qubits are measured at this moment.
4. execute(the_number_of_shots): Return the observed outcomes with their frequencies.

## Project status
Its partially done now 2-qubit gates are yet to be implemented
